# Lists

This covers all the different types of lists.

## Linked Lists

A linked list is a data structure that has a starting node (the head of the list) which contains the information that is being stored along with the reference to the next element. Each element will link to the next one, forming a list of links (hence, linked list). In Java this can be implemented using a Node object to represent a single element. Then a wrapper class to expose an interface for setting up and interacting with the list.
